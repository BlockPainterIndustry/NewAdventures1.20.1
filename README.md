The mod is work in progres. The first two alpha-versions are uploaded on [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/new-adventures-adventure-magic-alchemy)

## Future Plans

First Alpha Version: The mod will reach the first alpha Version (Version: alpha-0.1.0). Version alpha-0.1.0 will also be the first version I will release.

## Warning

Please Understand that all versions with alpha or beta in name could be unstable and or game breaking especially the versions uploaded on the dev branch. I will try to keep all versions in master aswell as the uploaded mods on the mod portal as clean and bug free as possible but understand that at this point i coding the mod alone and to this in my free time.
